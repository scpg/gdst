- ✅ Provides helpful error messages and guidelines

#### 2. **Enhanced Branch Creation Script** (`new-feature.sh.template`)
- ✅ Interactive mode with category selection
- ✅ Command-line mode with validation
- ✅ Automatic branch validation integration
- ✅ Support for issue numbers in branch names
- ✅ Improved user experience with clear instructions

#### 3. **Git Hooks Integration**
- ✅ Pre-commit hook for branch name validation
- ✅ Pre-push hook to prevent invalid branch pushes
- ✅ Automatic installation during setup
- ✅ Integration with existing pre-commit workflows

#### 4. **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**
- ✅ Branch name validation job in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Updated trigger patterns for new branch categories
- ✅ Automatic validation on pull requests
- ✅ Clear error messages for invalid branch names

#### 5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- ✅ Branch naming guidelines (`BRANCH_NAMING.md.template`)
- ✅ GitHub rulesets configuration (`GITHUB_RULESETS.md.template`)
- ✅ Complete examples and troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Organization-level ruleset templates

#### 6. **Updated Main Setup Script**
- ✅ Added `setup_branch_validation()` function
- ✅ Automatic installation of all validation components
- ✅ Updated help documentation and feature descriptions
- ✅ Enhanced dry-run support for all new features

### 🎨 Branch Naming Convention

#### Supported Categories:
```
feature/    - New features or enhancements
bugfix/     - Bug fixes
hotfix/     - Critical production fixes  
test/       - Experimental features or testing
chore/      - Maintenance tasks, refactoring
docs/       - Documentation updates
dev/        - Development branches
qa/         - QA and staging branches
release/    - Release preparation
```

#### Valid Examples:
```bash
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-error-fix
hotfix/security-patch
feature/123-shopping-cart
docs/api-documentation
chore/update-dependencies
```

### 🔧 Validation Layers

1. **Git Hooks** - Local validation before commits/pushes
2. **Interactive Script** - Guided branch creation
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Validation on pull requests
4. **Manual Validation** - `validate-branch-name.sh --help`

### 📚 Documentation Generated

1. **`docs/BRANCH_NAMING.md`** - Complete naming guidelines
2. **`docs/GITHUB_RULESETS.md`** - Repository ruleset configuration
3. **Enhanced README.md** - Updated features and examples
4. **Script help text** - Interactive guidance

### 🚀 Usage Examples

#### Create Branches Interactively:
```bash
./scripts/new-feature.sh --interactive
```

#### Create Branches Directly:
```bash
./scripts/new-feature.sh feature user-authentication
./scripts/new-feature.sh bugfix 123-login-error
```

#### Validate Branch Names:
```bash
./scripts/validate-branch-name.sh feature/user-auth  # ✅ Valid
./scripts/validate-branch-name.sh invalid-name      # ❌ Invalid
```

### 🎛️ Integration Points

#### Automatic Setup:
- All features are automatically installed when running `gdst.sh`
- Git hooks are configured automatically
- Documentation is generated automatically
- Scripts are made executable automatically

#### CI/CD Integration:
- GitHub Actions validate branch names on PRs
- Failed validation blocks merging
- Clear error messages guide developers

#### Developer Experience:
- Interactive branch creation guides proper naming
- Validation happens early (pre-commit/pre-push)
- Comprehensive documentation provides self-service help

### 📊 Benefits Achieved
